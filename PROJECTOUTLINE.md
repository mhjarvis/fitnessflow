I am creating a web application using react/nextjs. Right now I am working on building out the entire front end but also want to create a backend to make it a fullstack application. I want you to create me a complete outline for building the application, including the steps required, explanations, features, etc. Basically, provide me with everything i will need to build something cool and unique. Right now, the main features i want (plus anything you add) are a workout tracker, set/rep tracker for exercises, a fasting page that lets you track fasting information and how you are doing with it, a page for various calculators (e.g. body fat, calorie intake tracker, bmi, protein requirements, etc.), a user forum, etc. Give me a few additional suggestions for features i can add later.

Outline for Building the Application
Phase 1: Planning and Setup
Goal: Define the structure and set up the development environment.

Define Core Features
Workout Tracker: Log exercises, sets, reps, and weights with progress visualization.
Set/Rep Tracker: Detailed tracking for each workout session (e.g., 3 sets of 10 reps at 50 lbs).
Fasting Page: Track fasting periods (start/end times), goals (e.g., 16:8), and notes on how you feel.
Calculators Page: Body fat %, BMI, calorie intake (TDEE), protein needs, etc.
User Forum: Post questions, share progress, and reply to others.
User Authentication: Sign-up, login, and profile management.
Additional Feature Suggestions (to add later):
Progress Dashboard: Visualize workout and fasting progress with charts (e.g., weight lifted over time, fasting streaks).
Meal Planner: Log meals and track macros (protein, carbs, fats).
AI-Powered Suggestions: Use basic AI logic to recommend workouts or fasting schedules based on user data.
Social Sharing: Share workout achievements or fasting milestones on X (integrated via API).
Gamification: Earn badges for milestones (e.g., "100th workout" or "7-day fasting streak").
Set Up the Project
Frontend: Run npx create-next-app@latest fitpulse --typescript to scaffold a Next.js app with TypeScript.
Backend: Decide if you’ll use Next.js API routes (simpler) or a separate Node.js/Express server (more scalable).
Database: Set up PostgreSQL with a tool like Supabase (easy integration with Next.js) or MongoDB with Mongoose.
Version Control: Initialize a Git repository and push to GitHub.
Install Dependencies
Frontend: npm install tailwindcss @chakra-ui/react axios chart.js react-chartjs-2
Backend (if separate): npm install express pg dotenv (PostgreSQL) or mongoose (MongoDB)
Authentication: npm install @auth0/nextjs-auth0 or use Firebase.
Phase 2: Frontend Development
Goal: Build a responsive, interactive UI with Next.js.

Core Pages and Features
Homepage: Welcome message, quick stats (e.g., last workout, fasting status), and navigation.
Use Chakra UI for a clean layout.
Workout Tracker Page:
Form to log exercises (name, sets, reps, weight).
Table or card list to display past workouts.
Use react-hook-form for form handling.
Set/Rep Tracker:
Nested UI within Workout Tracker to input multiple sets per exercise.
Save data locally (state) before submitting to the backend.
Fasting Page:
Start/stop fasting timer with real-time updates.
Display fasting history and streak counter.
Use localStorage for temporary data and sync with backend on save.
Calculators Page:
Input fields for height, weight, age, activity level, etc.
Calculate BMI, TDEE, body fat %, etc., using formulas (e.g., Harris-Benedict for TDEE).
Display results with explanations.
User Forum Page:
List of posts with titles, authors, and timestamps.
Form to create new posts and replies.
Use infinite scroll or pagination for scalability.
State Management
Use React Context or Zustand for lightweight state management (e.g., user data, workout logs).
For complex data (e.g., forum posts), fetch from the backend via API calls.
Styling
Use Tailwind CSS for rapid prototyping and responsiveness.
Example: <div className="p-4 bg-gray-100 rounded-lg shadow-md">...</div>
Add dark mode support with Tailwind’s dark: prefix.
Phase 3: Backend Development
Goal: Create a robust API to handle data storage and logic.

Database Schema
Users: id, email, password_hash, username, created_at
Workouts: id, user_id, date, notes
Exercises: id, workout_id, name, sets (array), reps (array), weight (array)
Fasting: id, user_id, start_time, end_time, goal, notes
Forum_Posts: id, user_id, title, content, created_at
Forum_Replies: id, post_id, user_id, content, created_at
API Endpoints (Using Next.js API Routes or Express)
Authentication:
POST /api/auth/signup – Register a new user.
POST /api/auth/login – Login and return JWT.
Workouts:
POST /api/workouts – Create a new workout.
GET /api/workouts – Fetch user’s workouts.
Fasting:
POST /api/fasting – Start/stop a fasting session.
GET /api/fasting/history – Get fasting history.
Calculators:
(Handled client-side unless you want server-side validation.)
Forum:
POST /api/forum/posts – Create a post.
GET /api/forum/posts – Fetch all posts.
POST /api/forum/replies – Add a reply.
Backend Setup
If using Next.js API: Create files in /pages/api/ (e.g., workouts.ts).
If using Express: Set up a separate server with routes and connect to the database.
Use environment variables (.env) for sensitive data (e.g., database URL, JWT secret).
Phase 4: Integration and Testing
Goal: Connect frontend and backend, ensure everything works.

API Integration
Use Axios or Fetch to call backend endpoints from the frontend.
Example: Fetch workouts with axios.get('/api/workouts', { headers: { Authorization: Bearer ${token} } }).
Authentication
Protect routes (e.g., /workouts) with middleware or Auth0’s withPageAuthRequired.
Store JWT in localStorage or cookies.
Testing
Unit tests for calculators using Jest (npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react).
Manual testing for UI responsiveness and API calls.
Test edge cases (e.g., empty workout logs, invalid fasting times).
Phase 5: Enhancements and Deployment
Goal: Polish the app and make it live.

Enhancements
Add Chart.js for progress visualization (e.g., line graph of weights lifted).
Implement real-time updates for the forum using WebSockets (e.g., Socket.IO).
Add offline support with a Service Worker (Next.js PWA plugin).
Deployment
Push to Vercel: vercel --prod (handles Next.js frontend and API).
Set up a cloud database (e.g., Supabase) and update .env with credentials.
Configure domain and SSL (free with Vercel).
Development Timeline
Week 1: Setup, homepage, and workout tracker frontend.
Week 2: Fasting page, calculators, and backend setup.
Week 3: Forum, authentication, and API integration.
Week 4: Testing, enhancements (charts, etc.), and deployment.
Tips for a Cool and Unique App
UI: Use animations (e.g., Framer Motion) for a slick feel.
Community: Add a “Workout of the Day” feature sourced from forum posts.
Personalization: Let users customize their dashboard layout.
